    <li>Testimony of his courage: 
        <ul>
    <li>"Batman is the bravest hero I know. Even when Gotham is full of danger and scary villains, he never gives up. He faces his fears every day to keep us safe, and that makes me feel hopeful. I’m proud to live in a city protected by someone as courageous as Batman." — Suzie, Gotham City</li>
    <li>"Batman isn’t just brave—he’s really kind, too. One time, he helped a scared kid who was lost and even talked to someone who was making bad choices, trying to help them change. He cares about everyone, even those who have been hurt or are in trouble. That’s why I look up to him—not just as a hero, but as someone with a big, kind heart."
        — Tiny Tim, Gotham City</li>

    <li>Testimony of his strength of mind: 
        <ul>
    <li>"Batman’s strength isn’t just in his fists—it’s in his mind. Even after all the pain and loss he’s faced, he never stops fighting. He carries the weight of Gotham’s darkness on his shoulders but still finds the courage to keep going every single night. That kind of mental strength is what makes him a true hero."-anonymous stranger</li>
    <li>"People say Batman is just a man in a suit, but to me, his greatest power is his will. He’s been through hell and back, but he never lets his mind break. That kind of determination—facing fear, pain, and loneliness every day—is what keeps Gotham safe."-Maria- shop owner in Gotham</li>
